## Overview

The Tessellation project is a visual and interactive application developed in C++ using the OneLoneCoder's Pixel Game Engine. It demonstrates the concepts of geometric tessellations, allowing users to create and manipulate various shapes on a 2D canvas. This project showcases the ability to dynamically generate tessellations, interact with individual shapes, and observe the beauty of geometric patterns.

## Features

- **Dynamic Shape Creation:** Users can create various shapes, including triangles, squares, hexagons, and custom shapes like darts, by interacting with the application.
- **Interactive Tessellation:** Shapes can be tessellated across the 2D canvas, demonstrating the principles of tessellation in geometry.
- **Zoom and Pan:** The view can be zoomed in and out and panned across, offering a detailed examination of the tessellations.
- **Shape Manipulation:** Users can move, rotate, and snap shapes together to explore the geometric possibilities.

## Mouse and Keyboard Controls

### Mouse Controls

- **Left Click:** Place the current shape at the mouse cursor's location.
- **Right Click:** Undo the last placed shape.
- **Mouse Wheel:** Rotate the currently selected shape. Scrolling up rotates counter-clockwise, and scrolling down rotates clockwise.

### Keyboard Controls

- **Spacebar:** Cycle through the available shapes to place on the canvas.
- **Q/A:** Zoom in and out of the canvas. 'Q' zooms in, and 'A' zooms out.
- **Arrow Keys:** Pan the view in the direction of the arrow key pressed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tessellation project, clone this repository and open the solution file in Visual Studio. Build the project and run the executable to launch the application. Interact with the application using the mouse and keyboard controls listed above to create and manipulate tessellations.
